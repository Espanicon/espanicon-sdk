# Espanicon SDK
**Espanicon SDK** is a custom JS SDK for the ICON Network created specifically to be used in Espanicon projects related to development in the ICON Network. If you find it useful for your projects you are free to use it but we highly recommend that you use the official [ICON JS SDK](https://github.com/icon-project/icon-sdk-js)
